# Castle Project

* [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)
* [How to submit a fix](how-to-submit-a-fix.md)
* [Getting Pre-Release Castle Packages](prerelease-packages.md)

Every pull request that changes the software (readme and documentation changes excluded) needs to add an entry to the changelog (`CHANGELOG.md` file in the root of each repository). Changes for each release are broken into 3 sections: "Breaking Changes", "Enhancements" and "Bugfixes" (in that order).
